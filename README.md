# Covid Data analysis

I have performed data analysis using SQL on the files CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv and with help of that created Tableau Tables(1-4).

Refer SQL_Data_Exploration.sql to see SQL Queries

See Data visualization dashboard here : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saurabh.budhwani/viz/Covid_deaths_dashboard/Dashboard1

Using Ms SQL Server i performed following tasks:

    -Looking total cases vs total deaths
    -Looking at countries with highest infection rate
    -Looking at countries with highest death counts
    -Breaking down by continent
    -Global numbers
    -Overal total cases
    -looking at total population vs vaccination
    -Using CTE,to getpopulation vs vaccination
    -Creating view to store data for later visualizations
    
Then I used TableauTable(1-4) to create visualizations using tableau, reference to the dashboard is given above.
